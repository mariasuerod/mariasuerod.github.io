Hello, I am Maria!
<br>
I am an economist currently working as a research associate at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/rodriguesmariamiss/), Department of Mathematics and Statistics. My expertise include economic valuation methods in environment and agriculture (Discrete Choice modelling), bio-economic modelling, solving constrained optimization problems (using portfolio approach) in the context of forest economics and disease management. Currently, I am working on multiple [projects](https://mariasuerod.github.io/portfolio/) in interdisciplinary teams. I also have extensive experience [teaching](https://mariasuerod.github.io/teaching/) in economics and an associate fellowship in HE.
<br>

## Research interests

My research interests are in the areas of applied microeconomics more specifically applications in health, environment, agriculture, and behavioural economics.
