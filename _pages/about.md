Hello, I am Maria!
<br>
I am an economist currently working as a Research Fellow in Health Economics at the [University of Manchester](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/advanced.php?dn=cn%3DMaria+rodrigues+Rodrigues%2Bumanroleid%3D1421601%2Cou%3DDivision+of+Population+Health%5C%2C+Health+Services+Research+%26+Primary+Care%2Cou%3DSchool+of+Health+Sciences%2Cou%3DFaculty+of+Biology%5C%2C+Medicine+and+Health%2Cou%3DPeople%2Co%3DUniversity+of+Manchester%2Cc%3DGB&employeeType=STAFF&action=read&form_input=Submit)
Previously, I worked at [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/rodriguesmariamiss/), Department of Mathematics and Statistics as a Research Associate. My expertise include economic valuation methods in environment and agriculture (Discrete Choice modelling), bio-economic modelling, solving constrained optimization problems (using portfolio approach) in the context of forest economics and disease management. I have extensive experience collaborating on various [projects](https://mariasuerod.github.io/portfolio/) in interdisciplinary teams. I also have extensive experience [teaching](https://mariasuerod.github.io/teaching/) in economics and an associate fellowship in HE.
Currently, my research focuses on pharmacogenomics where I explore economics of pharmacogenomic panel tests.
