Hello, I am Maria!
<br>
I am an economist currently working as a research associate at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/) Department of Mathematics and Statistics. My areas of expertise include economic valuation methods in environment and agriculture (choice modelling), bio-economic modelling, solving constrained optimization problems (using portfolio approach) in the context of forest economics and disease management. Currently, I am working on multiple [projects](https://mariasuerod.github.io/portfolio/) in interdisciplinary teams. I also have extensive [teaching](https://mariasuerod.github.io/teaching/) experience and an associate fellowship in HE.

## Research interests

My research interests are in the areas of applied microeconomics more specifically health, environmental, agricultural, and behavioural economics.
